Description:
The Timer and Stopwatch project is a simple and efficient tool for time tracking, featuring countdown timers and stopwatch functionality.

The Timer and Stopwatch project likely focuses on providing functionalities to track and measure time accurately. It may include features like setting countdown timers, recording elapsed time, and possibly supporting multiple modes for different use cases (e.g., split times, alarms, or laps).
